    <h1>Tips for Success in Your Fitness Journey</h1>
    <p>I've found a few things key to my fitness journey (you can read more about that here) and thought I would share them with you!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accountability</li>
      <li>Journaling</li>
      <li>Celebrating Success</li>

  <h2>Accountability</h2>
  <p>Y'all. I cannot stress the importance of having accountability, creating a tribe to go on a fitness journey with you. This can be from one person to a whole group. If you're the type of person who needs a crowd to get your energized, look for a group of people to go on the journey with. If you have one person who will be your rock, pick them. Honestly, you do you - just find someone to help keep you accountable. I've done both before - it just depended on where I was in my life. In college, I had one person I leaned on - my would be husband. Now, I have a small group of girls who are the bomb.</p>
  <p>Word of advice ladies - find someone other than your spouse to be your accountability partner. Zach was my accountability before we got married but now I chose to have others. It doesn't work well to have the love of your life look at you and say "should you really be eating that cookie...?" (even if you asked them to keep you accountable).</p>
  <p>Finding partners for your fitness journey helps you with so many things! From someone to share the struggles with to showing up for workouts, the benefits are endless. Personally, I have never been more excited to go to the gym at 5:30am or after a long day at work then when I know my friends are their waiting for me. If you're not the kind of person who's motivated by social gatherings, find another motivation for an accountabliity partner or group - it could be something like helping a family member become healthier.</p>
  <h2>Journaling</h2>
  <p>Journaling wasn't an initial part of my fitness journey. I didn't start this until my recent dive back into fitness. It's been something that helped my greatly this time around.</p>
  <p>What's great about journaling is the space it creates to help you get in the write place mentaly. I use journaling to keep track of the foods I eat. By doing this, I am helping myself get into the mentality of appreciating healthy food. I set myself goals for the day's food & challenge myself to think about those goals when I chose what foods to eat. By writing it down, I am taking the time to think about what I eat, helping my to take responsibility for my food intake.</p>
  <p>This is just one way that journaling can help you in your fitness journey. Take the time to think about what your biggest hurdle is and how you might use journaling to over come it. For me, it was my unhealthy relationship with food. For you, it could be anything.</p>
