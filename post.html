    <img src="site-images/fitness-equipment.jpg" alt="fitness-equipment" class="fit-equip">    
    <p>I've found a few things key to my fitness journey (you can read more about that here) and thought I would share them with you!</p>
    <ul class="tips">
      <li>Accountability</li>
      <li>Journaling</li>
      <li>Celebrating Success</li>

  <h2>Accountability</h2>
  <img src="site-images/colaboration.jpg" alt="colaboration" class="colaboration">
  <p>Y'all. I cannot stress the importance of having accountability, creating a tribe to go on a fitness journey with you. This can be from one person to a whole group. If you're the type of person who needs a crowd to get your energized, look for a group of people to go on the journey with. If you have one person who will be your rock, pick them. Honestly, you do you - just find someone to help keep you accountable. I've done both before - it just depended on where I was in my life. In college, I had one person I leaned on - my would be husband. Now, I have a small group of girls who are the bomb.</p>
  <p>Word of advice ladies - find someone other than your spouse to be your accountability partner. Zach was my accountability before we got married but now I chose to have others. It doesn't work well to have the love of your life look at you and say "should you really be eating that cookie...?" (even if you asked them to keep you accountable).</p>
  <p>Finding partners for your fitness journey helps you with so many things! From someone to share the struggles with to showing up for workouts, the benefits are endless. Personally, I have never been more excited to go to the gym at 5:30am or after a long day at work then when I know my friends are their waiting for me. If you're not the kind of person who's motivated by social gatherings, find another motivation for an accountabliity partner or group - it could be something like helping a family member become healthier.</p>

  <h2>Journaling</h2>
  <p>Journaling wasn't an initial part of my fitness journey. I didn't start this until my recent dive back into fitness. It's been something that helped my greatly this time around.</p>
  <p>What's great about journaling is the space it creates to help you get in the write place mentaly. I use journaling to keep track of the foods I eat. By doing this, I am helping myself get into the mentality of appreciating healthy food. I set myself goals for the day's food & challenge myself to think about those goals when I chose what foods to eat. By writing it down, I am taking the time to think about what I eat, helping my to take responsibility for my food intake.</p>
  <p>This is just one way that journaling can help you in your fitness journey. Take the time to think about what your biggest hurdle is and how you might use journaling to over come it. For me, it was my unhealthy relationship with food. For you, it could be anything.</p>

  <h2>Goals & Celebrating Success </h2>
  <p>Goals are so powerful - they help us visualize the journey we're undertaking! It's important to create goals that matter to YOU! Doing a quick Google search for fitness goals is great but choose goals that will motivate you. Take a moment to visualize who you want to be 6 months into your fitness journey. Think about some of these things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why are you going on this journey?</li>
    <li>Who are you doing this for? Yourself, your kids, spouse or friends, anyone you want it to be.</li>
    <li>What do you want to be able to do 6 months from now? Run a 5k, fit into a smaller dress size, hike a canyon trail.</li>
    <li>What barriers will you face? Time, environment etc.</li>
    <li>How could you overcome those barriers?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember to reassess goals throughout your journey. Set time in your calendar to check-in on your goals. Share those goals with your accountability partners. After you have your 6 month goals, set smaller goals for along the way. Having only long term goals will leave you discouraged - you need to see success along the way. Remember, this is a journey not a sprint. Don't set yourself up to be discouraged after 6 months.</p>
  <p>After setting your long & short term goals, determine what your celebrations are going to be. This is one fun thing to do - set yourself small celbrations for short term goals and bigger ones for long term. Here are a few ideas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every two weeks you stick to a fitness or nutritional goal, rewards yourself with some extra shopping money.</li>
    <li>When you're able to cut down your mile time be 30 seconds, get a manicure.</li>
    <li>Fitting into a pair of jeans that were too small, rewards yourself with a fancy bubble bath.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Think about what brings you JOY! And rewards yourself with that. One thing to notice, what did none of my goals include? That's right - none of my celbrations included food or exerise. The goal might be food or exercise oritented but not the reward. By tying rewards to these things, it breeds the thought process that indulging in food or skipping exercise is something to seek. Not saying you can't cheat on your diet or skip a workout - just don't make that a reward.</p>
