  <h2>Accountability</h2>
  <p>Y'all. I cannot stress the importance of having accountability, creating a tribe to go on a fitness journey with you. This can be from one person to a whole group. If you're the type of person who needs a crowd to get your energized, look for a group of people to go on the journey with. If you have one person who will be your rock, pick them. Honestly, you do you - just find someone to help keep you accountable. I've done both before - it just depended on where I was in my life. In college, I had one person I leaned on - my would be husband. Now, I have a small group of girls who are the bomb.</p>
  <p>Word of advice ladies - find someone other than your spouse to be your accountability partner. Zach was my accountability before we got married but now I chose to have others. It doesn't work well to have the love of your life look at you and say "should you really be eating that cookie...?" (even if you asked them to keep you accountable).</p>
  <p>Finding partners for your fitness journey helps you with so many things! From someone to share the struggles with to showing up for workouts, the benefits are endless. Personally, I have never been more excited to go to the gym at 5:30am or after a long day at work then when I know my friends are their waiting for me. If you're not the kind of person who's motivated by social gatherings, find another motivation for an accountabliity partner or group - it could be something like helping a family member become healthier.</p>
